# Interactive-C-Programs-for-Character-Analysis-User-Options-Coordinate-System-and-Triangle-Validation
This project contains four distinct programs implemented in C, each designed to perform specific tasks based on user inputs. 

Each program is encapsulated in its own function:

Character Analysis:

● Objective: Determines if an entered character is a letter, and if so, whether it's uppercase or lowercase.

● Implementation: Uses conditional statements and the ctype.h library to classify the character.

Superhuman Law Division Options:

● Objective: Provides a menu of legal scenarios for superheroes, printing responses based on user selection.

● Implementation: Utilizes a switch statement to handle different user inputs, each corresponding to a specific scenario.

Coordinate System Quadrants:

● Objective: Determines the quadrant of a point in a 2D coordinate system based on user-provided x and y values.

● Implementation: Uses conditional statements to classify the point into one of the four quadrants or identify if it lies on an axis.

Triangle Validation:

● Objective: Checks if three given sides can form a valid triangle using the triangle inequality theorem.

● Implementation: Uses conditional statements to verify the sides and prints whether they form a triangle.
